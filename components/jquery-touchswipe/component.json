By default, this is one select that removes all form, input select, button and anchor elements.\n* **1.4.0** *2012-04-10*\n\t- Added pinch support, `pinchIn`, `pinchOut` and `pinchStatus`\n* **1.3.3** *2012-09-08*\n\t- Code tidy prep for minified version\n* **1.3.2** *2012-29-07*\n\t- Added `fallbackToMouseEvents` option to NOT capture mouse events on non touch devices.\n\t- Added \"all\" fingers value to the fingers property, so any combinatin of fingers triggers the swipe, allowing event handlers to check the finger count\n* **1.3.1** *2012-05-06*\n\t- Bug fixes  \n\t- bind() with false as last argument is no longer supported in jQuery 1.6, also, if you just click, the duration is now returned correctly.\n* **1.3.0** *2012-06-06*\n\t- Refactored whole plugin to allow for methods to be executed, as well as exposed defaults for user override. Added `enable`, `disable`, and `destroy` methods\n* **1.2.8** *2012-05-06*\n\t- Added the possibility to return a value like null or false in the trigger callback. In that way we can control when the touch start/move should take effect or not (simply by returning in some cases return null; or return false;) This effects the ontouchstart/ontouchmove event.\n* **1.2.7** *2012-05-06*\n\t- Changed time threshold to have null default for backwards compatibility. Added duration param passed back in events, and refactored how time is handled.\n* **1.2.6** *2012-14-05*\n \t- Added timeThreshold between start and end touch, so user can ignore slow swipes (thanks to Mark Chase). Default is null, all swipes are detected\n* **1.2.5** *2011-27-09*\n\t- Added support for testing swipes with mouse on desktop browser (thanks to https://github.com/joelhy)\n* **1.2.4** *2011-28-04*\n\t- Changed licence terms to be MIT or GPL inline with jQuery. Added check for support of touch events to stop non compatible browsers erroring.\n* **1.2.2** *2011-23-02*\n\t- Fixed bug where scope was not preserved in callback methods. \n* **1.2.1** *2011-23-02*\n\t- removed console log!\n* **1.2.0** *2011-23-02*\n\t- added `click` handler. This is fired if the user simply clicks and does not swipe. The event object and click target are passed to handler.\n\t- If you use the http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/ plugin, you can also assign jQuery mouse events to children of a touchSwipe object.\n* **1.1.0** *2011-21-02* \n\t- added `allowPageScroll` property to allow swiping and scrolling of page\n\t- changed handler signatures so one handler can be used for multiple events\n* **1.0.1** *2010-12-12*\n\t- removed multibyte comments\n* **1.0.0** *2010-12-12*\n\t- feature complete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
